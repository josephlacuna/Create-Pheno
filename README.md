# Create-Pheno-ADGC
The purpose of this script is to take in a list of NACCIDs in order to locate them in the UDS and MDS  Phenotype files. The relevant data for each subject is extracted and the variables are harmonized into the ADGC phenotype format outlined in the SOP data dictionary. Differences in the variable format between the UDS and MDS files creates complications that require documented conversions to ensure there is no confusion and that any possible errors can be tracked.  This script requires several input, including the appropriate version of the MDS, UDS, and APOE files as well as the list of relevant NACCIDs for extraction.
